## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Design Pattern: Multi-Page Static Website**
- The application follows a traditional multi-page architecture with separate HTML files for each section
- No JavaScript framework or build process required
- Client-side rendering only (static HTML pages)

**Rationale:** 
- Simplicity and ease of deployment without server-side requirements
- Fast loading times with minimal dependencies
- Easy to maintain and update content directly in HTML files
- Suitable for small business websites with primarily informational content

**Pros:**
- No build process or compilation needed
- Excellent SEO out of the box (static HTML)
- Fast page loads and minimal hosting requirements
- Easy for non-technical users to understand and modify

**Cons:**
- Code duplication across pages (navigation, footer, etc.)
- Manual updates required across multiple files for global changes
- No dynamic content management without additional tools

### Styling Architecture

**Design System: Tailwind CSS via CDN + Custom Configuration**
- Utility-first CSS framework loaded from CDN
- Custom color palette defined in inline Tailwind config
- Consistent design tokens for teal and orange branding

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: Teal (#17a2b8) - Brand color from company logo
- Primary Dark: Teal Dark (#0d8799)
- Accent: Orange (#ff6b35) - Secondary brand color from logo
- Base colors: White, Gray variations, Black
- Consistent with brand identity requirements

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Breakpoint strategy: mobile (default) → md (tablet) → larger screens
- Mobile navigation toggle for smaller screens

**Rationale:**
- CDN-based Tailwind eliminates build complexity
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Consistent spacing and sizing through utility classes
- Easy to maintain responsive layouts

### Navigation Architecture

**Pattern: Duplicate Navigation Across Pages**
- Each HTML page contains identical navigation markup
- Sticky navigation bar for consistent user experience
- Mobile hamburger menu with toggle functionality

**Current Limitation:** Navigation code is duplicated across all 8 HTML pages (index, about, services, portfolio, blog, contact, privacy, terms)

**Future Enhancement Opportunity:** Component-based approach or server-side includes could reduce duplication

### Page Structure
